# Apeiron

**A PyTorch framework for continual learning that detects concept drift in a live
data stream and adapts the model in place.**

Apeiron runs a monitoring loop over a changing data stream, watches an evaluation
metric, hands that metric to a drift detector, and — when the detector fires —
pauses monitoring to run a continual-learning update on the model before
resuming.

```{code-block} bash
:caption: Run a bundled example

poetry run python -m src.main --config examples/mnist/mnist.toml
```

## The loop

1. Evaluate the current model on stream batches.
2. Aggregate the monitored metric at a configured interval.
3. Run a drift detector on the aggregated metric.
4. On drift, pause monitoring and run a continual-learning update loop.
5. Resume monitoring on the updated model until stream limits are reached.
